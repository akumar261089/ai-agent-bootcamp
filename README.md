**Code Template:**  
```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from guardrails import add_guardrails

template = "You are a safe assistant. Answer {input} without unsafe actions."
safe_prompt = PromptTemplate(template)
guarded_agent = add_guardrails(agent, safe_prompt)

    if any(word in response for word in keywords):
        raise ValueError("Hallucinated response detected!")
    return response
```

**Exercise:**

```python
def safe_payment_api(amount):
    if amount > 1000:
        return "Error: Payment exceeds threshold."
    else:
        return "Payment successful!"
```

**Checkpoint:**  
✅ Agent can only invoke tools listed in the allowlist and follows pre-configured thresholds.
